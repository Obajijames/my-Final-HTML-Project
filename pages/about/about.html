    <p>Hi my name is James a communicator. I love inforamtion technology, little wonder I'm picking up classes in web development.
        I love designing too. I have proficiency in adobe illustrator, photoshop, canva, and coreldraw suite. 
        I recently completed a course in UI/UX design with figma. I'm a sports lover and passionate about reporting the latest on any sports issues.
        One last thing, I run an e-library to encourage readership in Africa and amongst young people.
        I believe one page a day will push back the frontiers of ignorance.
